<p> Fiuggi (Central-Northern Latian dialect: Fiuio) is a comune (municipality) in the province of Frosinone, in the Italian region of Latium. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Fiuggi_Water_Natural.jpg" alt="Fiuggi water" style="width:200px;height:350px;" class="second"> The town of Fiuggi became famous for its Acqua di Fiuggi (Fiuggi Water), which flows from its natural springs and mountains.

  The water has been used in Italy since as early as the 14th century and is famous for its purported healing properties. </p>

<h2><em>Main sights</em>
</h2>

<p>Fiuggi is divided into two parts:<br>
<ul>
  <li>upper</li>
  <li>lower</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The area where the springs are located is called new Fiuggi, or Fiuggi Fonte at the base of the hill (it was developed during the Middle Ages so it is not all that new). The upper part, or old Fiuggi, is 760 metres (2,500 ft) above sea level. The natives call it "Fiuggi Citta". Fiuggi Città is a medieval fortified village, which was around even before Roman times</p>

<h3><em>Culture</em></h3>

<p>The town is linked with the legend of the stuzze, in which Saint Blaise, in order to save the town from the assault of enemy troops, had fake flames appear on the town, deceiving the invaders and convincing them that the town had been already sacked. The miracle is today celebrated every February 2nd, when wooden pyramids are burned in the principal square of the town to remember the event.</p>
